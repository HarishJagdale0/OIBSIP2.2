            1949) Beginning in 1904, Naidu became an increasingly popular orator, promoting Indian independence and women's rights, especially women's education.[2] Her oratory often framed arguments following the five-part rhetorical structures of Nyaya reasoning.[7] She addressed the Indian National Congress and the Indian Social Conference in Calcutta in 1906.[2] Her social work for flood relief earned her the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in 1911[2], which she later returned in protest over the April 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre.[citation needed] She met Muthulakshmi Reddy in 1909, and in 1914 she met Mahatma Gandhi, whom she credited with inspiring a new commitment to political action.[8] She was the second woman President of the Indian National Congress and first Indian woman to preside over the INC conference .
